Removing SQLite:

- The ctags file should be updated into a single database (using a simple key/value store)
- Saving a single file should update the database for that file


DB format:


files.ctags
symbols.ctags

files.ctags

Each entry should be in the form of:
{file-path, [symbols]}

symbols.ctags

Each entry should be in form of:
{name, {TagEntry}}
